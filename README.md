# cambium task home

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Flutter Home Task
Requirements:
• Use the following API endpoint to retrieve the required data: https://random-data-
api.com/api/v2/users?size=100
• Display the retrieved data in a list view
Create two separate views:
1. A view for displaying the full list (using basic data such as avatar, first name, last
name, email, and date of birth—no need for all the data).
2. A view for displaying a favorites list.
• The favorites list should contain 10 objects, filtered from the main retrieved data se
(no special filtering required, choose any 10 favorite
• Provide an option to delete a data entry from the list (remove an object and refresh
the data)
• Ensure that the favorites list persists its data (when quitting and reopening the app,
the favorites should still be displayed without re-fetching)
• PAY ATTENTION TO USER EXPERIENCE! Tasks that require time to complete
should notify the user with a loading alert
Things to notice:
• Utilize at least 2 design patterns of your choice (e.g., MVVM, Factory, Singleton)
• Implement a state management architecture (e.g., Riverpod, BLoC).
• Attention to app design will be appreciated
• Maintain a proper file structure (directories, classe
Bonus Objective:
• Filter and display the list by the “date of birth” parameter (from youngest to oldest)
• Using Riverpod state management, along with libraries such as dio and freezed.
Expected time for this task: 2 days.
Good luck!
